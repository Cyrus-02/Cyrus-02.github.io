            <h2 class="p4">Favorite CMSC subject so far and why?</h2>
                <p class="p4">
                    CMSC 22. It's not that it's easy but even though its challenging for me
                    I enjoy the project when bits of pieces of the game is coming together.
                    I also enjoy modifying the design of game to my own liking.

            <h2 class="p4">Favorite GE so far and why?</h2>
                <p class="p4">
                    Before it was Ethics 1 but now its MATH 10. I'm currently taking MATH 10 
                    for the 2nd Semester. It's early to say but after the two meetings that we have
                    I know that this subject will revive my love for Math after having trauma with
                    Math 27, 28 and CMSC 150 XD. It shows the different side of Math and this GE will
                    teach us how to appreciate the beauty of Mathematics in different perspective.

            <h2 class="p4"> Favorite PL and why?</h2>
            <p class="p4">
                My Favorite PL so far is R. I struggle a lot on the lecture side but in lab, R is easy
                to use. Its very much straight forward.

            <h2 class="p4"> Childhood Dream</h2>
            <p class="p4">
                As far as I can remember, my dream job before was being a Farmer. This is because before,
                my lola had a wide space for planting in front of her house. According to
                my lola, most of the plants I planted grew well. I remember the Mango Tree I planted when I was a Child,
                sadly, now the tree is no longer there because of the renovation.
