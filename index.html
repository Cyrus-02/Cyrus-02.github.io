            <h2 class="p4">Favorite CMSC subject so far and why?</h2>
                <p class="p4">
                    CMSC 22. It's not that it's easy but even though its challenging for me
                    I enjoy the project when bits of pieces of the game is coming together.
                    I also enjoy modifying the design of game to my own liking.

            <h2 class="p4">Favorite GE so far and why?</h2>
                <p class="p4">
                    Before it was Ethics 1 but now its MATH 10. I'm currently taking MATH 10 
                    for the 2nd Semester. It's early to say but after the two meetings that we have
                    I know that this subject will revive my love for Math after having trauma with
                    Math 27, 28 and CMSC 150 XD. It shows the different side of Math and this GE will
                    teach us how to appreciate the beauty of Mathematics in different perspective.

            <h2 class="p4"> Favorite PL and why?</h2>
            <p class="p4">
                My Favorite PL so far is R. I struggle a lot on the lecture side but in lab, R is easy
                to use. Its very much straight forward.
